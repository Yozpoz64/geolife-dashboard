# GeoLife Dashboard
A user interface for running DBSCAN on fine-grained mobility on the GeoLife dataset. Theoretically can be applied to other datasets, but have not tested.

Point the program to the downloaded GeoLife dataset, then look at each user's mobility with DBSCAN clustering. Assumes a local PostGreSQL server with PostGIS.
Not very polished - designed for a uni assignment, but I think it could serve as a cool framework to be built on. Feedback welcome and appreciated!
